# About Me

I am a 3rd-year master student currently at EPFL, Switzerland, majoring in Data Science. I am interested in deep learning, natural language processing (especially in Large Language Models), meta learning and even vison-language models. Now I am doing my Master Thesis in the [Machine Learning and Optimization Laboratory](https://mlo.epfl.ch/) under the supervision of [Prof. Martin Jaggi](https://people.epfl.ch/martin.jaggi). Before that, I also finished my semester project in the same lab. In addition, I finished my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics.
