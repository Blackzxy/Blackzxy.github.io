# About Me

I am a master graduate from EPFL, Switzerland, majoring in Data Science. I am interested in Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing (especially in Large Language Models), Meta Learning, Optimization, and Reasoning. I am an incoming Ph.D. student under the supervision of [Zhijiang Guo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8b-u3icAAAAJ&hl=en). Before starting my Ph.D. study, I feel so honor and fortunate to finish my Master Thesis in the [Machine Learning and Optimization Laboratory](https://mlo.epfl.ch/) under the supervision of [Prof. Martin Jaggi](https://people.epfl.ch/martin.jaggi). I also finished my semester project in the same lab. In addition, I finished my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics.
