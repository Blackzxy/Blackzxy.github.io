# About Me

I am a master graduate from EPFL, Switzerland, majoring in Data Science. I am interested in deep learning, natural language processing (especially in Large Language Models, even Vison-Language Models), meta learning. I hope to build controllable AI systems and also show interests in Efficient-Learning, Continue-Learning. I feel so honor and fortunate to finish my Master Thesis in the [Machine Learning and Optimization Laboratory](https://mlo.epfl.ch/) under the supervision of [Prof. Martin Jaggi](https://people.epfl.ch/martin.jaggi). Before that, I also finished my semester project in the same lab. In addition, I finished my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics.

I am now working with [Dr. Jie Fu](https://bigaidream.github.io) as a research intern, also working close with MILA.
